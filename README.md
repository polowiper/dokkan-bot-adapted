# Dokkan Bot
This bot is based on the work of FlashChaser and his team (source code available at https://github.com/FlashChaser/Open-Source-Battle-Bot/).

The code has been completely reworked to be much more efficient and was functional at the time I was working on it.

The primary purpose of the bot was to learn Python and then to open it up to the public, so that you could upgrade as many cards as possible automatically (`farm medals <rarity>`).

I didn't go through with it due to lack of time, and today I've decided to share my code base with you.


## Support
