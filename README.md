# Dokkan Bot
This is based on the work of Tanukijs and FlashChaser and his team (source code available at https://github.com/tanukijs/dokkan-bot/tree/dev).

This is a very minimal way to use dokkan's WT API and most of the code has simply been erased. To find an actual working bot please refer to the original repo.

You are excpected to have the latest version of dokkan's database as well as a token for this code to work. If you don't, the code can easily be modified to enable the account creation as well as the database download part.
